<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student (Zhiyuan Honors) at the [Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Home), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/xiaolin). My research focuses on **efficient adaptation methods** for large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), with particular interests in **continual learning** and its applications to **intelligent agents**. 

I am now visiting the MMLab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under [Prof. Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/).

I am always open to academic discussions and potential collaborations and and please feel free to contact me via email / wechat: HzKinght

[VL-RouterBench: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Model Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23562)

**Zhehao Huang**, Baijiong Lin, Jingyuan Zhang, Yuhang Liu, Ning, Lu, Tao Li, Xiaolin Huang

[**Code**](https://github.com/K1nght/VL-RouterBench) \| [**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KinghtH/VL-RouterBench)

This paper addresses the lack of systematic evaluation for VLM routing by introducing **VL-RouterBench**, a comprehensive benchmark covering 14 datasets and 17 models that measures the trade-offs through evaluating 10 routing methods, it reveals a "routability gain" but highlights a gap between current routers and the Oracle, providing an open-source toolchain to advance more efficient, VLM routing deployments.

[RAIN-Merging: A Gradient-Free Method to Enhance Instruction Following in Large Reasoning Models with Preserved Thinking Format](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PO2iULmu5e)

**Zhehao Huang**, Yuhang Liu, Baijiong Lin, Yixin Lou, Zhengbao He, Hanling Tian, Tao Li, Xiaolin Huang

[**Code**]() \| [**Project**]() \| [**Dataset**]() \| [**Poster**]() \| [**Slides**]() (coming soon)

This paper identifies that LRMs struggle with strict instruction following despite reasoning, and introduces **RAIN-Merging**, a gradient-free method that integrates instruction-tuned features into the LRM's null space to preserve structured "thinking" formats while significantly enhancing constraint adherence across various scales and tasks without compromising reasoning quality.

[T2I-ConBench: Text-to-Image Benchmark for Continual Post-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16875)

**Zhehao Huang**, Yuhang Liu, Yixin Lou, Zhengbao He, Mingzhen He, Wenxing Zhou, Tao Li, Kehan Li, Zeyi Huang, Xiaolin Huang

[**Code**](https://github.com/K1nght/T2I-ConBench) \| [**Project**](https://k1nght.github.io/T2I-ConBench/) \| [**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/T2I-ConBench/T2I-ConBench)

This paper identifies that naive continual post-training in text-to-image models causes catastrophic forgetting and loss of compositionality, and introduces **T2I-ConBench**, a unified benchmark that evaluates models across four key dimensions—including generality retention and cross-task generalization, providing a standardized foundation for future research.

[A Unified Gradient-based Framework for Task-agnostic Continual Learning-Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15178.pdf)

**Zhehao Huang**, Xinwen Cheng, Jie Zhang, Jinghao Zheng, Haoran Wang, Zhengbao He, Tao Li, Xiaolin Huang

This paper demonstrates that learning and forgetting are mathematically linked through a unified framework, and proposes **UG-CLU** to balance new knowledge acquisition with precise data removal by using a weight-adaptation mechanism and manifold constraints, enabling stable, task-agnostic unlearning at both the category and sample levels without retraining from scratch.

[Unified Gradient-Based Machine Unlearning with Remain Geometry Enhancement](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/94324)

**Zhehao Huang**, Xinwen Cheng, Jinghao Zheng, Haoran Wang, Zhengbao He, Tao Li, Xiaolin Huang

This work proposes a fast-slow parameter update strategy to implicitly approximate the up-to-date salient unlearning direction, free from specific modal constraints, and adaptable across computer vision unlearning tasks, including classification and generation.

[Online Continual Learning via Logit Adjusted Softmax](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MyQKcQAte6)

**Zhehao Huang**, Tao Li, Chenhe Yuan, Yingwen Wu, Xiaolin Huang

[**Code**](https://github.com/K1nght/online_CL_logit_adjusted_softmax)

This paper shows that inter-class imbalance in online continual learning is fundamentally caused by imbalanced (time-varying) class priors, and proposes **Logit Adjusted Softmax (LAS)** to counter prior-induced bias by adjusting logits during training, improving performance across class-IL and class+domain incremental settings with minimal overhead.
